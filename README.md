# Certbase

A python utility to asynchronously resolve domains as they appear in Certstream

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Considerations

This will produce a ton of DNS requests. It's recomended to filter the domains and be a bit selective. I've limited some results, but YMMV.
